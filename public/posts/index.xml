      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-quick-rewind&#34;&gt;A quick rewind!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post, we built some of the core social features for our app â€” users can now follow each other, comment on posts, and hit that like button. Along the way, I also shared a bit about working with Cypher (Neo4jâ€™s query language) and how we used Pinecone as a vector store to index our data for similarity search, which is an important piece for our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In this post, weâ€™ll implement core social media features such as allowing users to follow others, create posts, and interact with them through likes and comments. Additionally, weâ€™ll set up a vector-based document storage system, which will serve as the foundation for integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities into our application.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;graph-database-what-and-how&#34;&gt;Graph database what and how?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently at work, I had the opportunity to dive into a new product that deals with highly complex, hierarchical data schemasâ€”deeply interconnected across multiple levels of business domains. To put it simply: imagine an ETL process pulling structured data from physical documents and presenting that data differently for different teamsâ€”each with their own use cases and logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the fun (and frustration) really began when we start thinking about how to handle these transformations. Some were done using custom functions, others using Java reflection (yes..yes, you read it right, we use java reflectionðŸ™ƒ).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Supercharging Your PostgreSQL with Functions &amp; Stored Procedures</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;tired-of-writing-the-same-sql-queries-over-and-over&#34;&gt;Tired of Writing the Same SQL Queries Over and Over?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re stuck in a loopâ€”executing the same SQL queries day in, day out. It feels a bit like Bill Murray in &lt;em&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/em&gt;, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?
&lt;img alt=&#34;Groundhog Day Gif&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExY2t2bWRoaTJqcGhweGJjajQ5eDdzbjRhcjQ1Z3lxOWhldDAzZG15ayZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/S9crjCfQXC78ST61iv/giphy.gif&#34;&gt;
You find yourself copying and pasting nearly identical code across different parts of your application or repeatedly typing out similar commands during database maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you could bundle these repetitive tasks into reusable, maintainable, and efficient code blocks inside your database? Good news: &lt;strong&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/strong&gt; makes this possible with &lt;strong&gt;Functions&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Stored Procedures&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
